                I am Chaowei Wu, with a preference in data mining, especially in the field in which theory and practice are related to each other closely, which would be promising and challenging in my opinion.
            </p>
            <p>				
				I practiced algorithm optimization and machine learning technology in <span><a href= "https://en.ccint.com/"> HEHE Tech. </a> <span>, my latest employer, during 2017-2018, as a data engineer. 
				
            </p>
            <p>
                My first employer, <span><a href= "http://www.shanghai-electric.com/PG/Pages/Index.aspx#"> SHANGHAI ELETRIC, </a> <span> hired me as a MECHANIC ENGINEER during 2014-2017. At that time, <span><a href= "https://www.ansaldoenergia.com/"> Ansaldo Energia S.p.A provided a three-month engineering training in Italy to me, which focused on industrial data analysis and engineering design. Experience in Italy reminded me the importance of English and spurred me to learn it well. What’s more, technology and culture there taught me that I should grasp more opportunities to learn abroad. Besides collaborating with Italian, I analyzed operational data and developed tools to speed up the analysis with the help of engineers employed by Siemens. The meaningful task buttressed engine maintenance service and brought enormous profits to my employer. Last but not least, in regard to engine performance prediction model, we tried to explore supervised learning method, such as regression and neural network.
            
            </p>
            <p>
                I got a BS degree and a MS degree in thermal energy in 2011 and 2014 respectively. The latest academic degree I got was master's degree in Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2014. At that time, I studied the Insdustry Intelligence Systems under the supervision of  <span><a href= "https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zw"> Prof. Wai Zhong.</a>

                    <li> Based on Spark and Hive, I guided a team to extract and analyze 200 million pieces of user portraits from 1.6 billion business card photos. The fundamental algorithm in the project is aggregation method based on graph theory and data mining technology.</li>
                    <li> Moreover, to construct a social network graph, my team and I analyzed millions of clients’ contacts by graphFrame & Spark. The task above is of extreme demand in computer resource and algorithm optimization, though equipped with a computer cluster equipped with 4Tb RAM and thousands of cores.</li>
					<li> To protect intellectual property, we submitted patent applications titled with “A Business Card Information Processing Method and its System” in 2018. I was in charge of the first three editions of the patent.</li>
