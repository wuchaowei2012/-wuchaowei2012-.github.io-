                    <li> Based on Spark/Hive, I guided a team to process billions business cards photos and extracted billions user portraits. The key algorithm in the project is aggregation method by graph calculation and text Lowenstein distance calculation. Statistical distribution of specific items, such as family name, would be concerned during the processing.</li>
                    <li>To grasp social network information, we processed millions of clients’ contacts and user portraits through graphFrame & Spark, and then inquired the results using Neo4j. The terminal goal of the project was to affect our promising clients’ behaviors toward the company’s benefits, by recommending them specific friends. The project puzzled my previous employer, though the team had billions of information and advanced clusters equipped with Tbs RAM and thousands of cores.</li>
